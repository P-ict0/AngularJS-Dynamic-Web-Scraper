# AngularJS Dynamic Web scraper

This is a dynamic web scraper specifically designed for AnsularJS websites that runs at specified time intervals.
This can be used to monitor when a new element is added to the website instead of having to manually refresh it.

Whenever a new element is discovered, it will notify you and save it to a file so that it doesn't notify you again for that same element in the future.

# Features

- **Automated Scraping:** Runs at user-defined intervals, extracting data without manual input.
- **Notification System:** Notifies users via Windows notifications when new data is found.
- **Robust Parsing:** Utilizes customizable search strings and regular expressions for data extraction.
